## I also repeat two select phrases. These include both “SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG” and “WE LOVE CASTING SPELLS”. When a teacher calls on me, (which they rarely do since they know what I’ll say) I shout one of the aforementioned quips. My peers then predictably stare at me awkwardly and whisper among themselves, which I understand as I am a very interesting person. Every once in a while, one of will be brave enough to talk to me, and ask if I can show them a magic trick. I pretend to agree and say “WE LOVE CASTING SPELLS ” and whip out my wand. As you know, I have no intentions of helping anyone since I am just condensed evil. I do not help the person that’s asking me to, I resort to my go to spell usually involving hot sauce (Tapatìo) in their anal cavity.
